# File Manager Specification
File Manager Specification is a Java project that defines an interface with methods for managing directories and files within one root directory. 
The interface includes methods for creating, deleting, moving, copying, downloading, renaming, finding, sorting, and filtering files.

This project is designed to demonstrate separating the specification and implementations, allowing for multiple implementations of the interface for different use cases. 
Two implementations, one for local files and another for Google Drive, are included as separate projects.
